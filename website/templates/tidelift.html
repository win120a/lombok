            Project Lombok and the maintainers of thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver one
            enterprise subscription that covers all of the open source you use.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want the flexibility of open source and the confidence of commercial-grade software, this is for you.

        <ul>
            <li>Get the tools you need to continuously catalog and understand the open source software that your
                application depends on.
            </li>
            <li>Your subscription helps pay the open source maintainers of the exact packages you use to ensure they
                meet the standards you require.
            </li>
            <li>Address issues proactively, with tools that scan for new security, licensing, and maintenance issues,
                and alert our participating open source maintainers so they can resolve them on your behalf.
            </li>
            <li>Measure and improve your open source dependencies' health—which improves your app’s health—and get a
                short list of high-impact steps your team can take to improve them even more.
            </li>
            <li>Get commercial assurances that don't come for free with open source packages, like intellectual property
                indemnification and support under a service level agreement. You expect these guarantees from
                proprietary software, and you can have them when using open source as well.
            </li>
        </ul>
        The end result? All of the capabilities you expect from commercial-grade software, for the full breadth of open
        source you use. That means less time grappling with esoteric open source trivia, and more time building your own
        applications—and your business.
