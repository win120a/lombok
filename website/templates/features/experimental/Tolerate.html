<@f.history>
<p>
    <code>@Tolerate</code> was introduced as feature in lombok v1.14.2<br/>
</p>
</@f.history>

<@f.experimental>
<ul>
    <li>
        Not used that much.
    </li>
    <li>
        Difficult to support for edge cases, such as recursive delegation.
    </li>
</ul>
</@f.experimental>

<@f.overview>
<p>
    Any method or constructor can be annotated with <code>@Tolerate</code> and lombok will act as if it
    does not exist. For example, normally lombok would not generate a <code>setDate</code> method for field
    named <code>date</code> if you already have a method named <code>setDate</code> in your code already. By
    annotating that method with <code>@Tolerate</code>, lombok will generate it anyway. This can be useful if the
    type of the parameter of your existing method is different and doesn't clash.
</p>
<p>
    Put on any method or constructor to make lombok pretend it doesn't exist, i.e., to generate a method
    which would otherwise be skipped due to possible conflicts.
