<@f.history>
<p>
    <code>@UtilityClass</code> was introduced as an experimental feature in lombok v1.16.2.
</p>
</@f.history>

<@f.experimental>
<ul>
    <li>
        Some debate as to whether it's common enough to count as boilerplate.
    </li>
    <li>
        Due to limitations in javac, currently non-star static imports <em>cannot</em> be used to import stuff from
        <code>@UtilityClass</code>es; don't static import, or use star imports.
    </li>
</ul>
Current status:
<em>negative</em> - Currently we feel this feature cannot move out of experimental status due to fundamental issues with non-star static imports.
</@f.experimental>

<@f.overview>
<p>
    A utility class is a class that is just a namespace for functions. No instances of it can exist, and all its members
    are static. For example, <code>java.lang.Math</code> and <code>java.util.Collections</code> are well known utility
    classes. This annotation automatically turns the annotated class into one.
</p><p>
    A utility class cannot be instantiated. By marking your class with <code>@UtilityClass</code>, lombok will
    automatically generate a private constructor that throws an exception, flags as error any explicit constructors you
    add, and marks the class <code>final</code>. If the class is an inner class, the class is also marked
    <code>static</code>.
</p><p>
    <em>All</em> members of a utility class are automatically marked as <code>static</code>. Even fields and inner
    classes.
</p>

<@f.confKeys>
<dt>
    <code>lombok.utilityClass.flagUsage</code> = [<code>warning</code> | <code>error</code>] (default: not set)
</dt>
<dd>
    Lombok will flag any usage of <code>@UtilityClass</code> as a warning or error if configured.
</dd>
</@f.confKeys>

<@f.smallPrint>
<p>
    There isn't currently any way to create non-static members, or to define your own constructor. If you want to
    instantiate the utility class, even only as an internal implementation detail, <code>@UtilityClass</code> cannot be
    used.
</p><p>
    Due to a peculiar way javac processes static imports, trying to do a non-star static import of any of the members of
    a `@UtilityClass` won't work. Either use a star static import: `import static TypeMarkedWithUtilityClass.*;` or
    don't statically import any of the members.
