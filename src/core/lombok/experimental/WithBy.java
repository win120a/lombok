/**
 * Put on any field to make lombok build a 'withBy' - a withFieldNameBy method which produces a clone of this object (except for 1 field which gets a new value).
 * <p>
 * Complete documentation is found at <a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/experimental/WithBy">the project lombok features page for &#64;WithBy</a>.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 *     private &#64;WithBy final int foo;
 *     private &#64;WithBy final String bar;
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * will generate:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     public SELF_TYPE withFooBy(@lombok.NonNull IntUnaryOperator operator) {
 *         int foo = operator.apply(this.foo);
 *         return this.foo == foo ? this : new SELF_TYPE(foo, bar);
 *     }
 *     public SELF_TYPE withBarBy(@lombok.NonNull Function&lt;? super String, ? extends String&gt; operator) {
 *         String bar = operator.apply(this.bar);
 *         return this.bar == bar ? this : new SELF_TYPE(foo, bar);
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This annotation can also be applied to a class, in which case it'll be as if all non-static fields that don't already have
 * a {@code WithBy} annotation have the annotation.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is primarily useful for hierarchical immutable data structures. For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     class Movie {
 *         &#64;WithBy private final Director director;
 *     }
 *
 *     class Director {
 *         &#64;WithBy private final LocalDate birthDate;
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Using plain old {@code @With}, to increment a movie's director's birth date by one, you would write:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     movie = movie.withDirector(movie.getDirector().withBirthDate(movie.getDirector().getBirthDate().plusDays(1)));
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * but with {@code @WithBy}, you'd write:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     movie = movie.withDirectorBy(d -&gt; d.withBirthDateBy(bd -&gt; bd.plusDays(1)));
 * </pre>
